This is the project I made for my Full Stacks Applications Class
This project was made using MAMP and PHPmyAdmin for hosting the server and the database.

This website is for a book club, where memebers can access a library of books that each member chooses to share!

There is a fully functional sign-in and sign-up feature.

All of the books that have been entered into the club are shown in the main library

Each user can add their own books and borrow books from other users. They can see the books they own and have borrowed.
One function I added in development to prevent the borrowing system from encountering any errors, is that the owner of 
a book must make a book that was recently returned availible for borrowing. Similar to aproving the return and putting it back on the shelf.

Each book has a log of its borrows and returns
