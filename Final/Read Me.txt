Hello!

All of the files required are inside this project folder
    - The ER Diagrams and the data for the database are all located in the data folder.
        - The Er diagram files + pdf
        - sql files: One forward engineered from mySQL Workbench (empty besides structure) and one from phpMyAdmin with my data in it.
    - Outside of all the folders is this file, the presentation file, and my project report.
        - This file contains the logins used, as are written below.

        

Here are the logins that I used in my project, including the one that I added during my demo in class
